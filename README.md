# Minesweeper Game

## Overview

This is a simple console-based implementation of the classic Minesweeper game. The game allows players to select different difficulty levels and provides functionalities such as flagging suspected bomb locations and timing the gameplay.

## Features

- **Dynamic Board Sizes**: Board size and the number of bombs adjust based on the selected difficulty level.
  - Easy: 5x5 board with 5 bombs
  - Medium: 10x10 board with 15 bombs
  - Hard: 15x15 board with 30 bombs
- **Flagging System**: Players can mark tiles as suspected bomb locations.
- **Game Timer**: The game records and displays the time taken to complete.
- **Tutorial Mode**: Provides instructions for new players.
- **Win and Lose Conditions**: The game ends with a win if all non-bomb tiles are revealed, or with a loss if a bomb is uncovered.

## How to Play

1. Start the game and choose a difficulty level.
2. Optionally, read the tutorial for instructions.
3. Use the following actions during gameplay:
   - `b x y`: Open a tile at position `(x, y)`.
   - `f x y`: Flag a tile at position `(x, y)` as a suspected bomb.
4. The objective is to open all non-bomb tiles without triggering a bomb.

## Build and Run

### Prerequisites

- A C compiler (e.g., GCC)
- Make sure the development environment supports standard I/O

### Compilation

To compile the game, use the following command:

```bash
gcc -o minesweeper CMinesweeper.c
```

### Execution

Run the compiled game with:

```bash
./minesweeper
```

## File Structure

- `CMinesweeper.c`: Main source code for the Minesweeper game.
- `README.md`: Documentation for the project.

## Example Gameplay

## Additional Notes

### Strategies
- Always start by opening tiles in the corners or edges to reveal large areas.
- Use flags wisely; only flag tiles when you are certain of a bomb's location.
- Look for patterns among the numbers to deduce bomb positions.

Happy Coding!
